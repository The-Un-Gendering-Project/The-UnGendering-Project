	<blockquote style="color:white">"The logo primarily consists of purple which is made by mixing pink and blue together- 
	the two colours representing the stereotype of the gender binary. 
	The face doesn't reflect on a particular gender and is open to interpretation;
	while the patches of colour inside are to represent the multiplicity of ways a person may express themselves regardless of the gender they are from"</blockquote>
